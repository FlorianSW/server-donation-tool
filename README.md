This server donation tool is meant to make it easier for gaming communities to allow their members to donate and earn differnet perks for their donation.
It seamlessly integrates with different platforms in order to automatically provision and setup perks for donators to reduce manual efforts for community admins and moderators.

## Key Features

- Self-services, guided donation on a modern website
- Integrated with PayPal for easy, self-service and secure payments
- Fully configurable packages, including configuring perks a donator earns, and the amount one needs to donate
- Perks available: Priority Queue (based on CFTools Cloud), Discord roles
- Discord notifications

## Installation & Configuration

The `config.full.yml` provides extensive documentation for each configuration option.
With the `config.example.yml`, there is a minimum configuration file, where you just need to replace the placeholder values to get started (it does not contain all the possible configuration values).

Additionally, the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started.md) will provide an easy-to-use step-by-step guide for a first-time setup.
